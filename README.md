# Human-brain-analysis
##  Created a java program which will determine the brain weight using head size and will tell the user of any deformity in the brain if       present using Machine learning.
##  The program uses linear regression and k-means clustering to predict the final result.
##  In order to run the is code in eclipse or on any Java IDE make sure you have weka jar file present in the referenced library in order     to import weka library classes
##  The accuracy of the model is 96.4%
##  Writing the code in java enables faster execution and also gives an advantage of strongly typed code
